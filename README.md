# Programming-Assignment-2: Banker Algorithm

# Overview
My name is Alicia Brown. For assignment 2 for Operating Systems, we had to add the values from a table into an input file and use the banker algorithm to avoid deadlock and find the safe sequence.
This program utilizes 

contents: banker.cpp, input.txt

# How it Works


Banker.cpp
- 


Input.txt
- contains the number of processes, the values of the maximums, the values of the allocations, and the available values.

# Example Output
System is in Safe State.
Safe sequence is: 1 3 4 0 2

# Problems Faced
Some of the problems I faced was figuring out how I should represent the values from the table in the input file and how to get the cpp file to read the values from the input file correctly.
